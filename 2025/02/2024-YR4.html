<p>Well, historically speaking, humanity has made great strides in emergency preparedness and disaster response.
In the wake of a catastrophic event, communities band together to rebuild and adapt.
We’ve seen this resilience after natural disasters; people come together to support one another.
We are clearly able to adapt to difficult situations, but what is the point? What is the end goal in this game?</p>

<p>Let’s assume for a second we manage to stop buttfucking our future. We shift our focus to sustainability and make conscious choices that benefit both our planet and our communities.
But then, what does that future look like? What are we really aiming for? Harvesting black hole energy as a type 3 civilization?
Alright, what’s next then? Even if we discover all of the universe’s secrets, it’s going to end at some point, maximum entropy baby!</p>

<p>I say we need a shortcut, and a bigger asteroid might just be perfect. An event we have no control over, no responsibility.
We could “skip the cutscene” so to speak, and walk into extinction with dignity and acceptance.
Instead of clinging to the hope of fixing a broken system, what if we chose to embrace the final destination (pun intended) we all share?
This perspective offers a profound sense of liberation in acknowledging that all things have an end.</p>

<p>I know, this is not an easy belief to adapt, but working 1st level support in IT generally helps.</p>
