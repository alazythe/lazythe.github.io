<p>“2024 YR4” refers to an asteroid that was discovered relatively recently and is classified as a near-Earth object.
On Feb. 18, there was a 3.1% chance that 2024 YR4, estimated to be around 60 to 90 meters in diameter,
would impact Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, with a speed of 61,200 km/h.</p>

<p>Given its size, a 60 to 90-meter asteroid would likely result in a localized explosion rather than a global extinction event.
The immediate area of impact would experience catastrophic effects, but the rest of the world will not face the same level of destruction.</p>

<p>A one to 32 chance of collision, the highest Earth has seen in decades, and all the universe was able to summon up is 90 meters in diameter?
Climate change, air pollution, resource depletion, social inequality, political instability, global health issues. All problems that could have been solved,
but no, 90 meters it is. It needs to be bigger.</p>

<h2 id="why-bigger">Why Bigger?</h2>

<p>Well, historically speaking, humanity has made great strides in emergency preparedness and disaster response.
In the wake of a catastrophic event, communities band together to rebuild and adapt.
We’ve seen this resilience after natural disasters; people come together to support one another.
We are clearly able to adapt to difficult situations, but what is the point? What is the end goal in this game?</p>

<p>Let’s assume for a second we manage to stop buttfucking our future. We shift our focus to sustainability and make conscious choices that benefit both our planet and our communities.
But then, what does that future look like? What are we really aiming for? Harvesting black hole energy as a type 3 civilization?
Alright, what’s next then? Even if we discover all of the universe’s secrets, it’s going to end at some point, maximum entropy baby!</p>

<p>I say we need a shortcut, and a bigger asteroid might just be perfect. An event we have no control over, no responsibility.
We could “skip the cutscene” so to speak, and walk into extinction with dignity and acceptance.
Instead of clinging to the hope of fixing a broken system, what if we chose to embrace the final destination (pun intended) we all share?
This perspective offers a profound sense of liberation in acknowledging that all things have an end.</p>

<p>I acquired this perspective on life when working 1st level support for my IT company.
By recognizing our impermanence, we can focus on living fully and meaningfully, making the most of the time we have left.
Or continue the same shit we’re doing, idk.</p>
